## Assetto Corsa Plugin

Copy this *vr-wind* folder in to */Steam/SteamApps/common/assettocorsa/apps/python*

To enable vr-wind, go to the in-game options, then under general, at the bottom of general options click to enable vr-wind.  vr-wind should work without the app overlay, but you can enable the app overlay to see the values being sent to the vr-wind controller.

*You will need to edit vr-wind.py and change serialPortName to reflect the COM port that the controller is assigned on your computer.*
